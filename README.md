A Two-Player Interactive Game on an FPGA

This repository contains the Verilog (.v) files necessary to implement a two-player badminton game on an FPGA. For a detailed overview of the project, including design concepts, implementation details, and demonstrations, please refer to the presentation slides:

Overview
Development Environment: Quartus Prime 18.1
FPGA Board: DE1-SoC
Display: VGA Monitor
User Input: PS/2 Controller
StickManBadminton-on-FPGA is designed as a two-player game that runs on the DE1-SoC board. After compiling the Verilog files in Quartus Prime 18.1, the bitstream is uploaded to the FPGA board, which then drives a VGA monitor to display the game. Players use a PS/2 controller to move the on-screen stickman characters and play badminton against each other.

Repository Contents
Verilog Source Files (.v):
All the necessary Verilog modules for the gameâ€™s logic, rendering, and input handling.
Note: This repository does not include configuration files for Quartus or other project-related files. You can create your own Quartus project and add these .v files as source modules.

Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the .v files.
Create a new project in Quartus Prime 18.1 (or a compatible version).
Add the Verilog files to your Quartus project.
Compile the project in Quartus Prime.
Program the DE1-SoC board with the resulting bitstream file.
Connect a VGA monitor and a PS/2 controller to the board.
Enjoy the two-player StickMan Badminton game!
